			n a world  where Dragons roam the land and the heavens, there exists a civilization with extraordinary magical powers. This world, the world of Dragonica, will take  new adventurers into the discovery of its riches and traditions. Since the  close of the Dragon War, dragons and humans lived in peace on separate worlds -  humans on their homeland, and dragons exiled to the depths of the Aether.<br>
			<br>
			It was not to last.<br>

			Consumed with the desire for revenge, the Dark Dragon Elga led a revolt that  brought the death of the Dragon Lord and an invasion of the human world.<br>
			One thousand years have passed since the Five Heroes of legend defeated Elga in  battle, and imprisoned him in the labyrinth prison of the Shadow Cabinet.<br>
			<br>
			But, peace never had a chance, it seems. Paris, one of the Five Heroes that  defeated Elga, in her unending thirst for power, offers a deal to her ancient  enemy, Elga. Paris offers her heart in exchange for immortality and everlasting  youth. In turn, Elga is promised freedom by Paris. Paris, however, betrays Elga and locks him up  in Drakos Tower.<br>
			<br>
			Blinded and  corrupted by the immense power, Paris launches an attack against her old  friends with the Ice Dragon, Kryos, by her side. Starting another bloody war in  the world of Dragonica. But she underestimated the courage of the heroes of  Dragon Fellowship, as Kryos was defeated and Paris was forced to go hiding once  again.<br>

			<br>
			Now, fuming  with her hatred against the Fellowship heroes, she returns to Elga in hopes of  gaining a powerful ally.<br>
			<br>
			A terrible  mistake, it seems, by Paris. Since Elga has been waiting for his moment of  revenge ever since he was betrayed by Paris. Filled with interminable rage, and  now with Paris’s eternal powers, Elga threatens to end the short-lived tranquility  for the heroes.<br>
			<br>
			As an old  foe makes his return, Dragonica heroes gain a valuable ally as well. The  Dragonkin race, with far more advanced culture and technology than the rest,  comes out of their 1000 year long seclusion to lend our heroes a hand.<br>
			<br>
			With new  allies and enemies adding fuel to the never-ending struggle, will ‘Peace’ be a  forever forgotten word in the world of Dragonica...?
